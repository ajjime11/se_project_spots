Project 3: Spots
https://ajjime11.github.io/se_project_spots/

Overview

Welcome to the Spots project! This is my third project in the TripleTen Software Engineering bootcamp, a significant step in my journey to becoming a professional developer. As I continue to build my portfolio and transition into a tech career, this project serves as a demonstration of my skills in responsive web design, specifically for popular screen sizes.

Images

For this project, I practiced a crucial industry skill: optimizing images directly from Figma. This ensures faster load times and a more efficient user experience. To further enhance performance, I've used tools like TinyPNG to compress the image assets.

My Wins

This project was a great opportunity to apply new concepts and overcome challenges. My key wins include:

Creating a fully responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different devices.

Practicing image optimization techniques for improved website performance.

Gaining more confidence in my front-end development skills.

Goals

As I continue my journey in software engineering, my goal is to solidify my technical skills and prepare for a rewarding career in the tech industry. This project is a foundational piece of that effort, helping me build the portfolio necessary for remote work in Data Annotation. I'm embracing the "tech bro" mindset and am determined to restore my "inner flame" and find success in this field.

Next Steps

This project is complete, but the learning continues. I am excited to apply the knowledge and experience gained here to future challenges as I progress through the TripleTen bootcamp and beyond.
